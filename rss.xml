I keep returning to the idea of skill transfer and exploring ways to strategically maximize the joyful dopamine hit of trying something interesting and/or hard and figuring it out. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/PXTJHCfbz-0&quot;&gt;Here’s a video of a talk on my anecdotal observations thus far.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer joy that chasing curiosity brings me has always driven me to inspire and encourage that type of curiosity in others. I’ve made a concerted effort to be active in my tech communities helping others. Among those groups theres also good conversations happening around mentorship and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently fell in a late night internet rabbit hole as one is wont to do. I started reading psychology research on skill and knowledge transfer between individuals.  I came across this interesting paper: &lt;a href=&quot;https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.523.6599&amp;#x26;rep=rep1&amp;#x26;type=pdf&quot;&gt;Bothered by Abstraction: The Effect of Expertise on Knowledge Transfer and Subsequent Novice Performance&lt;/a&gt;. The findings described in the abstract echoed many strains of how I had come to view learning and skill transfer so I dove in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, the research team was attempting to test the impact expertise has on knowledge transfer. They had beginners learn a simple skill they had no background in (constructing a simple electronic circuit). They had relative experts perform the same skill. Then both experts and beginners made instructional videos for novices. As some of you may have experienced, a relative beginner can be more effective than an expert in getting knowledge transferred to a novice. The paper supports the idea that it is difficult for experts to separate out the early concrete skills from the larger, hierarchical abstract concepts they have built on top of them. This makes beginners potentially more effective teachers in this particular type of scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their instructional videos, the experts used more abstract and advanced statements to explain the task. The beginners gave more simple, concrete statements. The beginner-taught novices had a higher rate of success on the initial task.   I remember when I was teaching Lighting Design coming to the realization that I didn’t remember &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I actually learned a good chunk of the material I was now teaching…I simply knew it and realizing that wouldn’t really be particularly useful to my students.  For those with expertise, it may be difficult to get away from more complex abstractions and advanced language when trying to relate to the current learning experience of the novice. You’re too far removed from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts don’t fret though - where it gets particularly interesting is that they gave the novices a second task. Half of them got the same task again, the other half got a new variant in a similar domain. In this second round, those that learned the first task from the expert and repeated the original task saw larger improvements on their performance than the beginner-taught novices. Those that received a different, related task also performed better if they learned the first task from the expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My key takeaways from reading this paper through the lens of my personal experiences in learning and teaching lots of new things lately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative beginners can be great teachers for skills they recently gained a level of competency in. They likely remember the experience of adding that bit of knowledge from a novice perspective. Leverage this when you’re doing something new and pay it forward while it’s fresh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts - be conscious when teaching basics to novices to emphasize simple statements and concrete steps for the first exposure to a new skill. You’re likely not doing it as much as you think you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all skill levels, the rate of success on learning a new skill is likely to be higher the first time if you focus on concrete, simple statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working outward from the concrete to the abstract accelerates learning and improvement on the target skill and transfer to adjacent skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mu from the Buddhist tradition - implying the question must be unasked, or that categorical thinking is delusional. Polar meaning directly opposite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I prepare to start the next phase of my career in Software Development, I’ve been taking time to reflect on memorable experiences I’ve had working with technology and other people. I recently wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://zenlex.github.io/persblog/abyss/intotheabyss&quot;&gt;blog post about a magical tree&lt;/a&gt; that I built with some students with the aim of learning more about generative art, collaborative creation processes, system design, and a variety of technical topics in hardware and software. The year prior I took on a similar type of project with my advanced lighting students. This is that story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Design / Build&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with virtually all recycled materials we collaboratively painted a mandala inspired floor, built a suspended cube and projected on the inside of it, and lit the surrounding space with over 100 theatrical LED fixtures to create ambiance and interactive elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We comandeered the main theatre space for this madness and lined the entry with various projects in photography and electronics the lighting students had completed over the course of the semester. Upon arrival on the stage, visitors were greeted with a sharply lit pathway in an otherwise dark space, beckoning them to come into the cube. Centered in the cube on a pedestal was a 16 pad MIDI controller connected to an iMac backstage. The game was written in Applescript and monitored the incoming MIDI stream, ran the game logic, and then sent commands to a QLab instance that remotely triggered the theatrical lighting fixtures and was also responsible for all the video projection playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote the game logic and created a custom sound scape and sound effects for the game and worked with my students to design and implement the lighting and projection systems.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLNxQygFoBo&amp;#x26;t=363s&quot;&gt;There’s a video Jay made documenting the installation and user experience that I also created original music for&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the video content was produced by a friend Jay Miller who was experimenting with creating 3D fractals and slicing them to create textural video and images. It was this concept of fractals and explorations of symmetry patterns that gave us the idea for the game logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of the game was simple. Initially (level ‘1’), you were simply required to press the same pad twice. Making the correct second pad choice triggered a flash of light and a change in video content making it obvious something ‘good’ had happened’ Pressing any other pad for the second choice lit the whole room up red and reset the game (‘bad’). Each time a player advanced a level with a correct sequence, the input sequence was lengthened by one, so on level two it needed to be an ABBA format, on level 3 ABCCBA, etc…always a mirrored symmetry getting longer by 2 each time it was entered correctly and shorter by 2 each time an error was made. After level 9 a ‘win’ sequence was triggered with exciting music and lights ballyhooing to and fro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick was that none of this was explained to anyone who entered. There was just 16 pads inviting you to play. It was amazing to watch the participants experiment and eventually figure it out and then watch others try and get frustrated when they could tell they weren’t getting it clearly but weren’t sure what ‘it’ was or what about it they weren’t getting, and the interactions between those who had completed it and those who were trying to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like the MaxMSTREE project I linked at the beginning of this piece, this proved to be another validating experience of the value of grabbing some cool people who are curious and diving headlong into the abyss of creativity with a toolkit full of skills and very little precedent. I highly recommend untethered acts of beautiful creation and reckless learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Get in losers, we're going to the abyss]]></title><description><![CDATA[A case study in learning by collecting curious friends and doing something together that none of you know how to
or the “you made your bed…]]></description><link>https://zenlex.github.io/persblog/abyss/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://zenlex.github.io/persblog/abyss/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A case study in learning by collecting curious friends and doing something together that none of you know how to
&lt;em&gt;or the “you made your bed now lie in it” school of creative learning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2015, a couple motivated, intelligent, and curious students of mine approached me with a request to learn more about technological tools for interactive experiences. As an educator I am always energized and motivated by anyone who expresses a genuine desire to learn something. The topic hardly matters. If you approach me and say “Hey, I know nothing about topic &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; but would like to”, be prepared as my instinctual response will be to grab you by the hand and leap head first into the abyss of the unknown, even if I know nothing about the topic myself. I’m not sure if these particular students knew that was the journey they were in for when they signed up or not, but it’s definitely what they got. What follows are some notes on the details and thoughts on the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we had approximately a 15 week semester as our time window. We had a budget of $0. As resourceful theatre rats though, I had an electrics shop full of random parts, a brain full of tangentially related knowledge, and a willingness to try just about anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make sure these students had ownership of the project and that my own excitement didn’t trounce that into subservience. To this end, I made it clear on day one that this was their project and their choices. I would be availble as researcher and tech support. I wanted them to gain insights into all the thinking, experimentation, decision making, communication, and revision work that goes into a good creative tech project and not just focus on the technical skills. (For context, one student was a musician and writer and the other a set designer and painter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up some initial parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They would have 1 week in the theatre at the end of the semester to install and exhibit their project to the public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They would have 1 week at the beginning of the semester to brainstorm a concept and make their pitch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would say yes to whatever their pitch was with as few caveats as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They decided they were interested in playing with some specific technologies - LEDs, Projected Video, and Electronic Music. What they ultimately conceived of was “Max/MSTree” - an installation that would consist of a tree-like sculpture in the center of the stage that bore touch sensitive ‘fruit’ that would react to users and light up. The surrounding world would also have lighting and video elements that responded in some fashion to people interacting with the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we ultimately ended up with was a lovely tree scultpture made from recycled materials that held paper lanterns as the ‘fruit’. Inside of each paper lantern we suspended a ring of RGB leds to color the lantern. We then connected the wire spring that provides structure to the lantern to an Arduino microcontroller to be used as a capacitive touch sensor. The Arduino served several purposes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It polled the ‘fruit’ for changing capacitance values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated the intensity/color of the leds inside the fruit based on the capacitance values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Took input from a large mushroom switch to allow users to cycle through color palettes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passed triggers from the mushroom switch to the theatrical lighting system to induce global changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serialized the capacitance data for each fruit and transmitted it via USB to a computer running Max/MSP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/persblog/1fc49bf30c2cd905f8f61e6982325a9b/BreadboardHookup.pdf&quot; alt=&quot;breadboard diagram&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of the tree sculpture, we hung a plot of theatrical lighting fixtures that allowed us to change the color and feel of the space. We created several ‘worlds’ and stored these looks in the lighting console. Triggers from the mushroom switch were also serialized into the USB stream to the central computer which were then formatted and transmitted to the theatrical lighting console via UDP to change the lighting in the room. We also installed a flexible ‘gooseneck’ USB webcam to capture video of the tree and the users. This video was passed through a series of modules in another Max/MSP instance to apply various artistic effects which were projected near the tree. The idea was that by manipulating the camera, users could ‘change their perspective’ (label on the camera), and by pressing the mushroom switch they could ‘change their world’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soundscape in the space was procedurally generated synthesis using the numeric values from the capacitance sensors to seed and manipulate the music using Max/MSP. It also took ‘theming’ parameters from the current ‘world’ selection made via the mushroom switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process was successful in both product and process. It had a lot of complex interactions and interconnected technical parts and was very well received by those who experienced it. More importantly though, almost all of the technical requirements of the installation were well beyond any scope of knowledge any of us had at the beginning of the 15 week process. So much valuable learning for myself as an educator and for these two brilliant students came out of the fact that we conceived of an idea that was well beyond any of our current areas of understanding or technical knowledge and had to figure out what strengths we each brought to the group and how we would collectively assemble the knowledge, resources, and skills needed to bring the vision to reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those larger lessons about systems and complexity, creative vision and technical implementation, and collaboration and resource sharing were formative and signficant lessons I think we all carry with us in one way or another to this day that would not have presented themseleves in the same fashion if the project was more prescribed or bound to ‘safe’ areas of preexisting knowledge at its outset. I cannot recommend the process of grabbing some curious friends and diving into something way out at your edge together highly enough. Figure out what you’re genuinely curious about, round up your curious friends, and dive into the abyss. The water’s great in here.&lt;/p&gt;
